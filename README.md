Bookbot is my first git project, It is sometimes hard and frustrating to learn how to code, but I learned a lot at 27 years of age.
Even though all the odds are against me right now, I will overcome the obstacles. I will have a nice life in the end. 
A life worth living for and I will make the lives around me better.
